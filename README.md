# 👋🏻 I'm a human-focused people manager who likes to build things. 

I've had lots of interesting technical roles over the past 20 years, including people management, project management, development, creative, and technical communication. I've worked in academic environments, startups, agency, enterprise, and hypergrowth organizations, and learned interesting things in each of them.
